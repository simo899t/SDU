Symbolic derivatives can give valuable insight into the structure of the problem domain and, in some cases, produce analytical solutions of extrema (e.g., solving for $diff/(diff x) f (x) = 0$) that can eliminate the need for derivative calculation altogether.

But they do not lend themselves to efficient runtime calculation of derivative values, as they can get exponentially larger than the expression whose derivative they represent
