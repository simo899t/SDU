Automatic differentiation techniques are founded on the observation that any function is evaluated by performing a sequence of simple elementary operations involving just one or two arguments at a time:
- addition
- multiplication
- division
- power operation $a^b$
- trigonometric functions
- exponential functions 
- logarithmic $ln(x)$
- chain rule $(d z)/(d x) = (d z)/(d y) dot (d y)/(d x)$
