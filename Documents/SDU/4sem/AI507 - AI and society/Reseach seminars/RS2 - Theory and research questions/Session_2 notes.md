#### Last time
- Value of teamwork
	- Descriptive vs. normative.
	- Not all are created equal
	- Ideal research circle
- Trustworthy science
	- Open science

#### Theories
Science is constantly questioning itself. Theories are our understanding of how something works, and as long as our observations/experiences fit to our (lay) theories – we tend to believe them. We make our theories explicit, formulate precise statements, test and evaluate them

- Scientific theories consist of **contructs** and **consepts**
- Precise **formulation**
- They are measured with **variables**
- Therefore, we try to translate to variables as much as possible

#### Different types of variables
- Categorical variables: **A** is different from **B** – but not necessarily better (e.g., men versus women, AI versus service worker)

- Ordinal variable: **A** is different from **B** and **C** – **ABC** are ranked, but they are not “equidistant” (**A** is MUCH better than **B**, but **B** only slightly better than **C**) – typical for grades, education etc.

- Parametric variables: **A** is as much better than **B** than **B** is compared to **C** – typical for scales, age, body size etc.

#### Establishing causality
Theories generally aim to establishing causality
- Cause = independent variable
- Consequence = dependent variable
Some hypotheses are causal though – some are also correlational (corralation does not mean causation)

#### Testing theories
We need to formulate the relationship in a theoretical statement 
- **Hypothesis:** a testable statement about the relationship between two or more concepts (variables) ()
- **Research question:** an open question about the relationship between two or more concepts
- **Propositions:** Description. Provides information about only one variable at a time – less useful than hypothesis
- **Assumptions:** A theoretical statement that is taken for granted. May describe the relationship between variables (similar to a hypothesis), or the usual value of one (as in propositions).

#### Link theoretical statements to their roots and tests
- The type of relations (linear, curvilinear etc.)
- Direction of the link (positive/ negative)
- Size of the relations (e.g., coefficient/ slope)
- Limits of the relations (e.g., ceiling effect)

#### Finding a scientific problem
1. **Sensitivity to provocative natural occurrences** (recognizing odd stuff, introspection, retrospective comparison, sustained observation) 
2. **Simple conceptual inference/ direct inference** (conversions of a banal proposition, conceptual division, jolting one’s conceptualizing out of its usual ruts)
3. **Complex conceptual inference/ indirect inference** (deductive reasoning, meta-theories, though diversification) 
4. **Past research** (reading past studies closely, integrating multiple past studies)
5. Collecting new data $->$ **Next Week**

#### Brainstorming
- Generetive AI makes you take less qualified decisions thus makeing you act less intelligent. This is because you have less judgement, and rely on AI.
- Using AI to do creative tasks is bad because it undermines creativity.
