Qualitative
- Explores how and why
- Enables in-depth insights on topics that are not well understood
- Interviews
- Manual qualitative content analyses

Quantitative
- Tests the "what," "how many," or "how often" using numerical, statistical data
- Enables testing theoretical statements
- Online-questionnaires (“surveys”)
- Experiments


My turn
- surveys, things like "how does you think your learning is benifittet from gen AI"
- compare with data, do the people think they are better than they actually are. are they being fooled
