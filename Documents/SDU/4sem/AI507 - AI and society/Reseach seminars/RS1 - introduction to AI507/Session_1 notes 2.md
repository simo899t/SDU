#### What are the social sciences?
- Social scientists try to understand humans
- Actions, values, beliefs
- Interactions with each other and their environment
- Structure of societies
- Back then, today, and in the future

#### Descriptive vs. normative science
Descriptive: (Positivist account: The truth is out there)
- How things work
- What causes them to work that way
- How things relate to one another

Normative: (Constructivist account: The truth is partially relative)
- How things ought to work
- Why they should work a certain way
- What should change for things to work differentially
