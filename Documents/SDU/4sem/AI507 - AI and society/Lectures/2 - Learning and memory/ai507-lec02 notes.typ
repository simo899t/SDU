- *Short-term memory*
  - (magic number “7” +/-2, today 4-5)
- *Long-term memory*
  - Explicit (what happened when), Implicit (how)
- Retrieval (recognition, recall, reconstruction)
  - retrieving memories with recall or recognising something from the memory.
  - When you remember a specific thing, like a situation, (reconstruction) to remeber other things.

== Behaviourism
- Classical conditioning (strong cues), like pawlovs dogs
- Operational conditioning (doves playing pingpong)

== More generally, how do we learn
- *Priming*
  - When two brain processes are activated together or in immediate succession, the activation of one spreads to the other
- *Competition among predictors*
  - Our world is complex -- in each moment, myriads of stimuli could be relevant
  - To save energy, our brain thus sets them in direct competition to each other -- only the best ones survive
  - If there is already a relevant stimulus, new ones are blocked
  - Only stimuli that provide unique new information are learned
- *Configural learning*
  - Our brain loves efficiency -- so we often learn things as a “bundle” (Schema theory)
  - Consider learning how someone looks like -- for example Zendaya -- you don’t learn her hair and eye colour separately. This allows you to recognize her even with her “dune” eyes
- *Generalization and similarity*
  - Projecting our knowledge to new situation
    - example, you know how to bike in sunny weather, so you kinda know how to bike in rain.
  - The lower the similarity between situations or stimuli, the better do we learn to distinguish between them
    - Shift your attention to different dimension
    - Shift your attention to different values on the dimension
- *Note (some exceptions)*
  - *Reinforcement learning*
    - seems to be more powerful -- Just watching soccer doesn’t make you a successful player
  - *Interval of stimuli*
    - The interval between the stimuli matters -- and variety keeps your brain from zooming out
- *Unlearning*
  - If a stimulus is paired with a response and the response never comes, the pairing goes extinct over time
