= Our self
- Each situational norm engages different aspects of the self $->$ steers the encoding and retrieval of our “self-knowledge” such as:
  - working self-concept
  - relational self-concept
  - personal self-concept
- This is also stored in schrema
- We have more differet selves
  - *Actual* or current self (that's where the behaviour matters)
  - Ideal self, (who we want to be)
  - Ought self (what we think, who we should be)
  - Feared self (what we could become and don't want too)

= Needs and regulations
Need for accuracy: 
- To make our future outcomes predictable, we need a fairly accurate assessment of our abilities, opinions, beliefs, and emotions

Need for consistency:
- To trust our accuracy judgements, we need to have a pretty consistent/ stable self-concept → we often seek situations that confirm how we see ourselves (e.g., procrastination to confirm that we are unable to solve a task)

Self-enhancement: 
- We need to feel good about ourselves and maintain self-esteem → Source of a lot of
biases (e.g., we remember our good deeds better than our faults, perceive us as less biased, more competent and happier than others)
