Suppose that we have a dataset where we can't easily classify data using a support vector ([[4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)]]). We can transform the space using a transformation function, to model the data by using more dimentions. Take the example from the lectures
$$T(x,y)=(x^2,y^2,sqrt(2)x^2 y^2)$$

This way we can use a hyperplane of $+1$ dimensionality to classify the data.
