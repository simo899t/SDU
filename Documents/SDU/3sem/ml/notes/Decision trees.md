for the decision vector $v=vec(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ with a decision range of $Lambda = [0,1]$
then length of string from a tree is then $$ceil(log_2(d+3))(n+1)$$ for $d="len"(v)$   


Reasons for overfitting for DT's
1. $m$ is too small (not enough data)
2. Dimentionality ($d$) is too big
3. Number of nodes (#$n$)
## Random forests
### Bootstrapping
random picking (dont take all posibilities)
### Aggregation
