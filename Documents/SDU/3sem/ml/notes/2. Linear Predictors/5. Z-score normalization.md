A model outputs the following:

Means: [-0.00031786 0.00045392 -0.00103062 -0.00226024 -0.00069973 -0.00092399 -0.00058225 0.00039851 0.00066739 -0.00087822] 
Variances: [0.00222035 0.00226498 0.00217988 0.00219522 0.00233499 0.00234279 0.00229155 0.00229439 0.0023026 0.00222032]

Clearly these means vary a lot in scales (-0.0023 is almost 10x larger than -0.0003)

To avoid unintentionally prioritizing the features with larger numbers we can normalize (using *Z-score normalization*)

Assume that some data is normal distributed with some mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. That is, each dimension $x_d$ of a $D-$dimensional observation $x$ comes from a sampling process as below:$$\epsilon \sim N(0,1),\quad x_d = \mu_d + \sigma_d \epsilon$$
We can then $$x' = \frac{x_d -\mu_d}{\sigma_d} = \epsilon $$
And thus we can center and scale based on the sample mean $mu$ and standard deviation $sigma$.
