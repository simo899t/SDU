#### Estimator
A function that estimates a value. Very simple

Fx we can estimate a mean $\hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$

#### **Estimator Bias:** 
The **bias** of an estimator $f$ is defined as $B(f) = E[f(S)] - \theta$, where $B(f)$ is Bayes Error

An estimator is said to be **unbiased** if $B(f) = 0$.

However, the sample variance $S^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \widehat{X})^2$ is a biased estimator of the variance $\sigma^2$ of a random variable $X$. That is why is it common to use the **unbiased sample variance** $\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \widehat{X})^2$ instead of the sample variance $S^2$. The change made in the denominator is called **Bessel's correction**.

**Think of it like shooting at a target:**
- Unbiased estimator:
	- Your shots are **centered** on the bullseye (true value)
	- Sometimes you're high, sometimes low
	- **On average**, you hit the center
	
- Biased estimator:
	- Your shots are **systematically off-center**
	- Maybe always shooting a bit to the left
	- **On average**, you miss the target, but... in a predictable direction :O
