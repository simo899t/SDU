Consider an integral of the form:
$$EE[f(x)]=I = integral f(x) p(x) dif x.$$
for some function $f(x)$ and probability density function $p(x)$. If we can take $m$ samples from $p(x)$, we can approximate the integral by the sample average:
$$I \approx \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m f(x_i),$$
where $x_i \sim p(x)$. This is called the **Monte Carlo integration**.
