Take the zero-one loss $ell(y,y´) = II(y != y´)$ as an example

Then we want to minimize $L_(D,f) (h):= PP_(x tilde D)[f(x)!=h(x)]$
$$ h_* = arg min_h L_(D,f) (h) $$

Since $f(x)$ is unknown we can find the average using actual true results
$$h_S = arg min_h L_S (h) = arg min_h (abs({i in [m], h(x)-f(x)}))/(m)$$
This is not well defined and has weaknesses regarding the hypothesis. We resolve to curve fitting.
