    "The take-home message of the above theorem and its corollary is that there is no universal learner that works well for all data distributions. There always exists a task for which the learner fails. This is a very important result. It tells us that we need to make assumptions about the data distribution in order to design a good learner. These assumptions will constitute the **inductive bias** of the learner. The no free lunch theorem tells us only that we need to induce a degree of bias to the learner. However, it does not tell anything about its consequences. Inducing too much bias limits the ability of the learner to explain the training observations. Inducing too little bias leads to overfitting. The goal is to find the right balance between the two. This dilemma is known as the **bias-complexity dilemma**. \n",

    "Let us describe the bias-complexity dilemma in more formal terms. Given an ERM solution $h_S \\in \\arg \\min_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}} \\widehat{R}_S(h)$ for a hypothesis space $\\mathcal{H}$, we can decompose its generalization error as below\n",

The second term is called the **estimation error** and denoted by $\\epsilon_{est}$. This term is the remainder of the generalization error after the approximation error.  Since for any $\\mathcal{H'} \\supset \\mathcal{H}$, it holds that $\\min_{h' \\in \\mathcal{H}'} R(h') \\leq \\min_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}} R(h)$, we can influence the approximation error via our choices on the hypothesis space. Other things such as the learning algorithm and data distribution being equal, the generalization error will give us a fixed budget. Hence, approximation and estimation error will need to be traded off against each other. Increasing the hypothesis space, thereby making our solution more complex will reduce the approximation error, but will increase the estimation error. Since the realizability assumption implies a smaller training error, we will observe overfitting in this scenario. The opposite will be true when we restrict the hypothesis space.\n",
