Assume the following random samples following a Binomial distribution:

$X_i \sim \text{Binomial}(3, \theta)$, which represents the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials (in this example: 3), where some former observations are provided as follows: $S = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\} = \{1, 3, 2, 2\}$.
