- question 1 gradient descent
	- **FALSE** 
	- **FALSE** dimentions is not respresented with view
	- **TRUE** we base on labels so yes
	- **TRUE** 
	- **TRUE**
- question 2 
	- NOT CORRICULUM
- question 3 kNN
	- **FALSE** as training size increase, variance decreases
	- **FALSE** test accuracy is better when k is large
	- **TRUE** test error will never be better than training
	- **TRUE** if 2 data points are better than 1
	- **TRUE** less complexity means less overfitting
- question 4 coins
	- **FALSE** variance can not be less than 0
	- **TRUE** $EE[X]=2.1$
	- **TRUE** $0.2+0.5 = 0.7$
	- **FALSE** does not make sense
	- **TRUE** sum is equal
- question 5 random variables
	- **FALSE** because $(a+b)(c+d) = a c+a d+b c+b d$
	- **TRUE** because $Var[\sum_{i=1}^n X_i] = \sum_{i=1}^n Var[X_i]$
	- **TRUE** $EE[X_1+X_2]=EE[X_1^2]+EE[X_2^2] = mu_1^2+mu_1^2+sigma^2+sigma^2$
	- **TRUE** because $\text{If } X \perp Y: \quad \mathbb{E}[XY] = \mathbb{E}[X] \cdot \mathbb{E}[Y]$
	- **FALSE** because a is dependant on a
- question 6 set prob
	- **FALSE** because $b=b+ac$
	- **FALSE** 
	- **FALSE** beacuse $a =c-ac$
	- **FALSE** because $0-1-1+1 gt.not 0$
	- **FALSE** since $A union B subset A union B unionC$
- question 7 coins
	- **TRUE** same for both since four coin tosses and fair coin
	- **FALSE** no only for 1 coin
	- **TRUE** only one way of this
	- **FALSE**
	- **FALSE** i can know more about B by knowing A
- question 8
	- NOT CORRICULUM
- question 9
	- **FALSE**
	- **FALSE**
	- **TRUE**
	- **FALSE** its not uniform nor 2 classes
	- **FALSE** these are equal
- question 10 
	- **FALSE**
- question 11
	- **TRUE** since both first coin is $H$
	- **TRUE** evidence is better than none
	- **TRUE** the same
	- **FALSE** the opposite
	- **TRUE** would be more likely
